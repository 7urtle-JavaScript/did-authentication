Congratulations for reaching my repository, brave developer! This project is still very much in progress

You will need .env file. You can find the template for it in .env_template

Apart from installing packages you will also need to to some setup with MATTR to obtain your own own DID Key and DID Presentation template
which is currently done through:
```
$ npm run setup-did
```

To run backend simulating Netlify functions:
```
$ npm run functions
```

To run React frontend:
```
$ npm run dev
```

The project is open source, so feel free to reach out to me to contribute.
